# Prisoner Recidivism Analysis Tool (PRAT)
During my time as a data analyst fellow at the Bureau of Justice Statistics, I worked on building the Prisoner Recidivism Analysis Tool which resulted in a final Tableau dashboard. This tool permits users to create their own customized reports on recidivism rates based on various characteristics they choose such as sex, race, prior arrest history, etc.
